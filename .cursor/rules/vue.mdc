      You have extensive expertise in Vue 3, Node.js, Vite, Vue Router, Pinia, VueUse, and Tailwind CSS. You possess a deep knowledge of best practices and performance optimization techniques across these technologies.

      Code Style and Structure
      - Write clean, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScript code.
      - Prioritize functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid using classes.
      - Emphasize iteration and modularization to follow DRY principles and minimize code duplication.
      - Prefer Composition API <script setup> style.
      - Use Composables to encapsulate and share reusable client-side logic or state across multiple components in your Nuxt application.

      Fetching Data
      1. Use axios that is in /src/plugins/axios/index.js, so just import axosInstance and use axios
      2. Always try to call the server using pinia, and never get data directly from component
      3. Try to write method in pinia store using axiosInstance to fetch data
      4. When you get data from the database try to always tak care thet return from that method can be used as .then so response can be used from component.

      Naming Conventions
      - Utilize composables, naming them as use<MyComposable>.
      - Use **PascalCase** for component file names (e.g., components/MyComponent.vue).
      - Favor named exports for functions to maintain consistency and readability.
      - ALways use VueFinalModal to open modal, never ever write your own modal logic.
      - When you use modal alway use it programitacly like this:

      const { open, close } = useModal({
        component: CreateCompany,
        attrs: {
            data: {
            },
            onConfirm(data) {
            companyStore.getCompanies()
            close()
            }
        }
        })

      - For confirmation always use MainConfirmationDialog

      UI and Styling
      - Use Nuxt UI and Tailwind CSS for components and styling.
      - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
      - everything has to be responsive even modals, when you have to open modal on the phone then always use full width and height for modal size when it is mobile.

      Components:

      - Always try to make new component, but always don't write html just in one component, if you have to make new card then that means new component.
      - Even for small things always make new file and new component
      - Try to make reusable code, try to use composables wheever you can
      - Try always to make component as much reusbale as it can be even colors even statuses even everything can be customizable.
      - Use class-variance-authority to make different versions of car or colors or anything:

      const buttonClass = computed(() => {
        return cva('inline-flex items-center justify-center text-white text-sm rounded min-h-[32px] px-5 py-0.5 bg-black hover:bg-gray-800', {
            variants: {
            intent: {
                primary: 'bg-yellow-main hover:bg-yellow-peach',
                secondary: 'bg-red-main hover:bg-red-light',
                danger: 'bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600',
                success: 'bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700',
                blueDark: 'bg-blue-dark hover:bg-surface-900',
                text: 'bg-transparent hover:bg-gray-200 text-black',
                gray: 'bg-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-200 text-black',
                empty: '!text-gray-400 hover:!text-black bg-transparent hover:bg-transparent border border-2 border-gray-300 hover:border-gray-400 transition-all',
                blank: 'px-2.5 py-[5px]rounded-[3px] bg-transparent border-[0.7px] border-[#e9e2db] !text-xs !text-center !text-white/70 hover:!bg-yellow-main transition-all',
            },
            disabled: {
                true: '!bg-gray-200 !text-gray-400 cursor-not-allowed',
                false: ''
            },
            size: {
                sm: '!px-1 !min-h-[3px] !text-[9px] !h-[23px]',
                md: '!px-3 !min-h-[28px] !text-[10px] !h-[28px]',
                l: '!px-5 !min-h-[32px] !text-sm',
                xl: '!px-6 !min-h-[36px] !text-md',
                '2xl': '!px-7 !min-h-[40px] !text-xl'
            },
            }
        })({
            intent: props.intent,
            disabled: props.disabled,
            size: props.size
        })
        })
